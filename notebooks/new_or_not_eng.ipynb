    "[\"The proposed development is aimed at conducting experimental studies of the relationship between the microstructure of the flow around miniature obstacles commensurate with the thickness of the viscous sublayer of the boundary layer in the near-wall region of the channel relatively low discrete roughness elements, with heat transfer intensification effects. This will allow a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of heat transfer intensification and will contribute to the development of methods for predicting hydrodynamic and thermal processes in such channels under turbulent flow conditions. A fundamentally new approach to studying these phenomena will be the analysis of the relationship between the dynamics of separation region formation and the phase of turbulent pulsations above the shear layer behind the obstacle. The authors hypothesize that under certain conditions, the separation zone can greatly decrease in size and practically disappear, and such conditions may be of great interest in terms of increasing the thermal-hydraulic efficiency of heat exchange devices.\",0],\n",

This new theoretical approach can be used in new algorithms for implementing computer simulations of anomalous transport processes, which will make it possible to control the relationship between spatiotemporal nonlocalities.
