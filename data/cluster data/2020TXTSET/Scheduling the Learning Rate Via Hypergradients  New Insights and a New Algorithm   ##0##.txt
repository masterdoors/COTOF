We study the problem of fitting task-specific learning rate schedules from the perspective of hyperparameter optimization. This allows us to explicitly search for schedules that achieve good generalization. We describe the structure of the gradient of a validation error w.r.t. the learning rates, the hypergradient, and based on this we introduce a novel online algorithm. Our method adaptively interpolates between two recently proposed techniques (Franceschi et al., 2017; Baydin et al.,2018), featuring increased stability and faster convergence. We show empirically that the proposed technique compares favorably with baselines and related methodsin terms of final test accuracy. automl, hyperparameter optimization, learning rate, deep learning
