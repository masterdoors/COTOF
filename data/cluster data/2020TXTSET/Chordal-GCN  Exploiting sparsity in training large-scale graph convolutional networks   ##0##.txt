Despite the impressive success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on numerous applications, training on large-scale sparse networks remains challenging. Current algorithms require large memory space for storing GCN outputs as well as all the intermediate embeddings. Besides, most of these algorithms involves either random sampling or an approximation of the adjacency matrix, which might unfortunately lose important structure information. In this paper, we propose Chordal-GCN for semi-supervised node classification. The proposed model utilizes the exact graph structure (i.e., without sampling or approximation), while requires limited memory resources compared with the original GCN. Moreover, it leverages the sparsity pattern as well as the clustering structure of the graph. The proposed model first decomposes a large-scale sparse network into several small dense subgraphs (called cliques), and constructs a clique tree. By traversing the tree, GCN training is performed clique by clique, and connections between cliques are exploited via the tree hierarchy. Furthermore, we implement Chordal-GCN on large-scale datasets and demonstrate superior performance. graph convolutional network, semi-supervised learning
