Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have boosted the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and graph classification. Recent researches show that graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which deliberately add carefully created unnoticeable perturbation to the graph structure. The perturbation is usually created by adding deleting a few edges, which might be noticeable even when the number of edges modified is small. In this paper, we propose a graph rewiring operation which affects the graph in a less noticeable way compared to adding deleting edges. We then use reinforcement learning to learn the attack strategy based on the proposed rewiring operation. Experiments on real world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To understand the proposed framework, we further analyze how its generated perturbation to the graph structure affects the output of the target model.
