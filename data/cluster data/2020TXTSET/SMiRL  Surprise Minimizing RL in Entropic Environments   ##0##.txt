All living organisms struggle against the forces of nature to carve out niches where they can maintain relative stasis. We propose that such a search for order amidst chaos might offer a unifying principle for the emergence of useful behaviors in artificial agents. We formalize this idea into an unsupervised reinforcement learning method called surprise minimizing RL (SMiRL). SMiRL trains an agent with the objective of maximizing the probability of observed states under a model trained on all previously seen states. The resulting agents acquire several proactive behaviors to seek and maintain stable states such as balancing and damage avoidance, that are closely tied to the affordances of the environment and its prevailing sources of entropy, such as winds, earthquakes, and other agents. We demonstrate that our surprise minimizing agents can successfully play Tetris, Doom, and control a humanoid to avoid falls, without any task-specific reward supervision. We further show that SMiRL can be used as an unsupervised pre-training objective that substantially accelerates subsequent reward-driven learning intrinsic motivation, reinforcement learning, unsurpervised RL
