Learning communication via deep reinforcement learning has recently been shown to be an effective way to solve cooperative multi-agent tasks. However, learning which communicated information is beneficial for each agent s decision-making remains a challenging task. In order to address this problem, we introduce a fully differentiable framework for communication and reasoning, enabling agents to solve cooperative tasks in partially-observable environments. The framework is designed to facilitate explicit reasoning between agents, through a novel memory-based attention network that can learn selectively from its past memories. The model communicates through a series of reasoning steps that decompose each agent s intentions into learned representations that are used first to compute the relevance of communicated information, and second to extract information from memories given newly received information. By selectively interacting with new information, the model effectively learns a communication protocol directly, in an end-to-end manner. We empirically demonstrate the strength of our model in cooperative multi-agent tasks, where inter-agent communication and reasoning over prior information substantially improves performance compared to baselines.
