In the industrial field, the positron annihilation is not affected by complex environment, and the gamma-ray photon penetration is strong, so the nondestructive detection of industrial parts can be realized. Due to the poor image quality caused by gamma-ray photon scattering, attenuation and short sampling time in positron process, we propose the idea of combining deep learning to generate positron images with good quality and clear details by adversarial nets. The structure of the paper is as follows  firstly, we encode to get the hidden vectors of medical CT images based on transfer Learning, and use PCA to extract positron image features. Secondly, we construct a positron image memory based on attention mechanism as a whole input to the adversarial nets which uses medical hidden variables as a query. Finally, we train the whole model jointly and update the input parameters until convergence. Experiments have proved the possibility of generating rare positron images for industrial non-destructive testing using countermeasure networks, and good imaging results have been achieved.
