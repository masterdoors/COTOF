In modern supervised learning, many deep neural networks are able to interpolate the data  the empirical loss can be driven to near zero on all samples simultaneously. In this work, we explicitly exploit this interpolation property for the design of a new optimization algorithm for deep learning. Specifically, we use it to compute an adaptive learning-rate in closed form at each iteration. This results in the Adaptive Learning-rates for Interpolation with Gradients (ALI-G) algorithm. ALI-G retains the main advantage of SGD which is a low computational cost per iteration. But unlike SGD, the learning-rate of ALI-G uses a single constant hyper-parameter and does not require a decay schedule, which makes it considerably easier to tune. We provide convergence guarantees of ALI-G in the stochastic convex setting. Notably, all our convergence results tackle the realistic case where the interpolation property is satisfied up to some tolerance. We provide experiments on a variety of architectures and tasks  (i) learning a differentiable neural computer; (ii) training a wide residual network on the SVHN data set; (iii) training a Bi-LSTM on the SNLI data set; and (iv) training wide residual networks and densely connected networks on the CIFAR data sets. ALI-G produces state-of-the-art results among adaptive methods, and even yields comparable performance with SGD, which requires manually tuned learning-rate schedules. Furthermore, ALI-G is simple to implement in any standard deep learning framework and can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing code. optimization, adaptive learning-rate, Polyak step-size, Newton-Raphson
