Successfully training deep neural networks often requires either {batch normalization}, appropriate {weight initialization}, both of which come with their own challenges. We propose an alternative, geometrically motivated method for training. Using elementary results from linear programming, we introduce Farkas layers  a method that ensures at least one neuron is active at a given layer. Focusing on residual networks with ReLU activation, we empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in training capacity in the absence of batch normalization or methods of initialization across a broad range of network sizes on benchmark datasets. initialization, deep networks, residual networks, batch normalization, training, optimization
