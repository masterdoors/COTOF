Adversarial attacks were shown to be very effective in degrading the performance of neural networks. By slightly modifying the input, an almost identical input is misclassified by the network. To address this problem, we adopt the universal learning framework. In particular, we follow the recently suggested Predictive Normalized Maximum Likelihood (pNML) scheme for universal learning, whose goal is to optimally compete with a reference learner that knows the true label of the test sample but is restricted to use a learner from a given hypothesis class. In our case, the reference learner is using his knowledge on the true test label to perform minor refinements to the adversarial input. This reference learner achieves perfect results on any adversarial input. The proposed strategy is designed to be as close as possible to the reference learner in the worst-case scenario. Specifically, the defense essentially refines the test data according to the different hypotheses, where each hypothesis assumes a different label for the sample. Then by comparing the resulting hypotheses probabilities, we predict the label and detect whether the sample is adversarial or natural. Combining our method with adversarial training we create a robust scheme which can handle adversarial input along with detection of the attack. The resulting scheme is demonstrated empirically.
