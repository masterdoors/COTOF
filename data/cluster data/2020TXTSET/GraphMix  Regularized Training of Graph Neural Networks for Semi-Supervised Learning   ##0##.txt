We present GraphMix, a regularization technique for Graph Neural Network based semi-supervised object classification, leveraging the recent advances in the regularization of classical deep neural networks. Specifically, we propose a unified approach in which we train a fully-connected network jointly with the graph neural network via parameter sharing, interpolation-based regularization and self-predicted-targets. Our proposed method is architecture agnostic in the sense that it can be applied to any variant of graph neural networks which applies a parametric transformation to the features of the graph nodes. Despite its simplicity, with GraphMix we can consistently improve results and achieve or closely match state-of-the-art performance using even simpler architectures such as Graph Convolutional Networks, across three established graph benchmarks  Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as three newly proposed datasets   Cora-Full, Co-author-CS and Co-author-Physics.
