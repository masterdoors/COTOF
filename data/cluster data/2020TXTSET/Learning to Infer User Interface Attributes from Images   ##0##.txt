We present a new approach that helps developers automate the process of user interface implementation. Concretely, given an input image created by a designer (e.g, using a vector graphics editor), we learn to infer its implementation which when rendered (e.g., on the Android platform), looks visually the same as the input image. To achieve this, we take a black box rendering engine and a set of attributes it supports (e.g., colors, border radius, shadow or text properties), use it to generate a suitable synthetic training dataset, and then train specialized neural models to predict each of the attribute values. To improve pixel-level accuracy, we also use imitation learning to train a neural policy that refines the predicted attribute values by learning to compute the similarity of the original and rendered images in their attribute space, rather than based on the difference of pixel values.
