Finding out the computational redundant part of a trained Deep Neural Network (DNN) is the key question that pruning algorithms target on. Many algorithms try to predict model performance of the pruned sub-nets by introducing various evaluation methods. But they are either inaccurate or very complicated for general application. In this work, we present a pruning method called Fast Neural Network Pruning (FNNP), in which a simple yet efficient evaluation component called ABN-based evaluation is applied to unveil a strong correlation between different pruned DNN structures and their final settled accuracy. This strong correlation allows us to fast spot the pruned candidates with highest potential accuracy without actually fine tuning them. FNNP does not require any extra regularization or supervision introduced to a common DNN training pipeline but still can achieve better accuracy than many carefully-designed pruning methods. In the experiments of pruning MobileNet V1 and ResNet-50, FNNP outperforms all compared methods by up to 3.8%. Even in the more challenging experiments of pruning the compact model of MobileNet V1, our FNNP achieves the highest accuracy of 70.7% with an overall 50% operations (FLOPs) pruned. All accuracy data are Top-1 ImageNet classification accuracy. Source code and models are accessible to open-source community.
