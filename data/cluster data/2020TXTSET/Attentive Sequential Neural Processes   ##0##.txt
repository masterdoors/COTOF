Sequential Neural Processes (SNP) is a new class of models that can meta-learn a temporal stochastic process of stochastic processes by modeling temporal transition between Neural Processes. As Neural Processes (NP) suffers from underfitting, SNP is also prone to the same problem, even more severely due to its temporal context compression. Applying attention which resolves the problem of NP, however, is a challenge in SNP, because it cannot store the past contexts over which it is supposed to apply attention. In this paper, we propose the Attentive Sequential Neural Processes (ASNP) that resolve the underfitting in SNP by introducing a novel imaginary context as a latent variable and by applying attention over the imaginary context. We evaluate our model on 1D Gaussian Process regression and 2D moving MNIST CelebA regression. We apply ASNP to implement Attentive Temporal GQN and evaluate on the moving-CelebA task. meta-learning, neural processes, attention, sequential modeling
