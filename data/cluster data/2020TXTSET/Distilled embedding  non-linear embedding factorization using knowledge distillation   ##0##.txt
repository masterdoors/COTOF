Word-embeddings are a vital component of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems and have been extensively researched. Better representations of words have come at the cost of huge memory footprints, which has made deploying NLP models on edge-devices challenging due to memory limitations. Compressing embedding matrices without sacrificing model performance is essential for successful commercial edge deployment. In this paper, we propose Distilled Embedding, an (input output) embedding compression method based on low-rank matrix decomposition with an added non-linearity. First, we initialize the weights of our decomposition by learning to reconstruct the full word-embedding and then fine-tune on the downstream task employing knowledge distillation on the factorized embedding. We conduct extensive experimentation with various compression rates on machine translation, using different data-sets with a shared word-embedding matrix for both embedding and vocabulary projection matrices. We show that the proposed technique outperforms conventional low-rank matrix factorization, and other recently proposed word-embedding matrix compression methods.
