Determining the source of uncertainties in the predictions of AI systems are important. It allows the users to act in an informative manner to improve the safety of such systems, applied to the real-world sensitive applications. Predictive uncertainties can originate from the uncertainty in model parameters, data uncertainty or due to distributional mismatch between training and test examples. While recently, significant progress has been made to improve the predictive uncertainty estimation of deep learning models, most of these approaches either conflate the distributional uncertainty with model uncertainty or data uncertainty. In contrast, the Dirichlet Prior Network (DPN) can model distributional uncertainty distinctly by parameterizing a prior Dirichlet over the predictive categorical distributions. However, their complex loss function by explicitly incorporating KL divergence between Dirichlet distributions often makes the error surface ill-suited to optimize for challenging datasets with multiple classes. In this paper, we present an improved DPN framework by proposing a novel loss function using the standard cross-entropy loss along with a regularization term to control the sharpness of the output Dirichlet distributions from the network. Our proposed loss function aims to improve the training efficiency of the DPN framework for challenging classification tasks with large number of classes. In our experiments using synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our DPN models can distinguish the distributional uncertainty from other uncertainty types. Our proposed approach significantly improves DPN frameworks and outperform the existing OOD detectors on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset while also being able to recognize distributional uncertainty distinctly. predictive uncertainty, distributional uncertainty, Dirichlet distribution, out-of-distribution detection, deep learning
