In this paper, we propose a novel kind of kernel, random forest kernel, to enhance the empirical performance of MMD GAN. Different from common forests with deterministic routings, a probabilistic routing variant is used in our innovated random-forest kernel, which is possible to merge with the CNN frameworks. Our proposed random-forest kernel has the following advantages  From the perspective of random forest, the output of GAN discriminator can be viewed as feature inputs to the forest, where each tree gets access to merely a fraction of the features, and thus the entire forest benefits from ensemble learning. In the aspect of kernel method, random-forest kernel is proved to be characteristic, and therefore suitable for the MMD structure. Besides, being an asymmetric kernel, our random-forest kernel is much more flexible, in terms of capturing the differences between distributions. Sharing the advantages of CNN, kernel method, and ensemble learning, our random-forest kernel based MMD GAN obtains desirable empirical performances on CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN bedroom data sets. Furthermore, for the sake of completeness, we also put forward comprehensive theoretical analysis to support our experimental results. GANs, MMD, kernel, random forest, unbiased gradients
