A key feature of intelligent behavior is the ability to learn abstract strategies that transfer to unfamiliar problems. Therefore, we present a novel architecture, based on memory-augmented networks, that is inspired by the von Neumann and Harvard architectures of modern computers. This architecture enables the learning of abstract algorithmic solutions via Evolution Strategies in a reinforcement learning setting. Applied to Sokoban, sliding block puzzle and robotic manipulation tasks, we show that the architecture can learn algorithmic solutions with strong generalization and abstraction  scaling to arbitrary task configurations and complexities, and being independent of both the data representation and the task domain.
