We propose a new form of an autoencoding model which incorporates the best properties of variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN). It is known that GAN can produce very realistic samples while VAE does not suffer from mode collapsing problem. Our model optimizes  -Jeffreys divergence between the model distribution and the true data distribution. We show that it takes the best properties of VAE and GAN objectives. It consists of two parts. One of these parts can be optimized by using the standard adversarial training, and the second one is the very objective of the VAE model. However, the straightforward way of substituting the VAE loss does not work well if we use an explicit likelihood such as Gaussian or Laplace which have limited flexibility in high dimensions and are unnatural for modelling images in the space of pixels. To tackle this problem we propose a novel approach to train the VAE model with an implicit likelihood by an adversarially trained discriminator. In an extensive set of experiments on CIFAR-10 and TinyImagent datasets, we show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art generation and reconstruction quality and demonstrate how we can balance between mode-seeking and mode-covering behaviour of our model by adjusting the weight   in our objective.
