Learning from only partially-observed data for imputation has been an active research area. Despite promising progress on unimodal data imputation (e.g., image in-painting), models designed for multimodal data imputation are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose variational selective autoencoders (VSAE) for this task. Different from previous works, our proposed VSAE learns only from partially-observed data. The proposed VSAE is capable of learning the joint distribution of observed and unobserved modalities as well as the imputation mask, resulting in a unified model for various down-stream tasks including data generation and imputation. Evaluation on both synthetic high-dimensional and challenging low-dimensional multi-modality datasets shows significant improvement over the state-of-the-art data imputation models. data imputation, variational autoencoders, generative models
