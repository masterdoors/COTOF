In information extraction, event extraction is one of the types that extract the specific knowledge of certain incidents from texts. Event extraction has been done on different languages texts but not on one of the Semitic language Amharic. In this study, we present a system that extracts an event from unstructured Amharic text. The system has designed by the integration of supervised machine learning and rule-based approaches together. We call it a hybrid system. The model from the supervised machine learning detects events from the text, then, handcrafted rules and the rule-based rules extract the event from the text. The hybrid system has compared with the standalone rule-based method that is well known for event extraction. The study has shown that the hybrid system has outperformed the standalone rule-based method. For the event extraction, we have been extracting event arguments. Event arguments identify event triggering words or phrases that clearly express the occurrence of the event. The event argument attributes can be verbs, nouns, occasionally adjectives such as     wedding and time as well. Event extraction, machine learning classifiers, Nominal events
