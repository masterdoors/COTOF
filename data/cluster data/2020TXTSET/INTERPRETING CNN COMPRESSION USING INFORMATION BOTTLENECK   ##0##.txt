In this paper, we first investigate the representation learned in convolutional neural networks at the filter-wise granularity by computing the mutual information between channels of higher conv-layers and input or output variables. Then we identify the approximate minimal sufficient statistics of learned representation based on the information bottleneck principle and propose a novel approach to automatically compress a neural network. This approach prunes a large trained network structurally and automatically by extracting relevant information backpropagately layer by layer in the post-training phase. Our experimental results match the two fundamental data processing inequalities, and prove that mutual information is a fundamental element for examining the efficiency of the internal representations at the filter-wise granularity. In addition, using the information bottleneck principle to interpret structure compression is an efficient method to get closer to the information theoretic limit of compression prediction problem. Finally, from the observed results, we argue that compression is causally linked to the improved generalization performance. Learning Representation, Information Bottleneck, Model Compression
