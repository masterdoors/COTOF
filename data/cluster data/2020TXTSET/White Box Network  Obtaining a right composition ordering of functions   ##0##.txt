Neural networks have significantly benefitted real-world tasks. The universality of a neural network enables the approximation of any type of continuous functions. However, a neural network is regarded as a non-interpretable black box model, and this is fatal to reverse engineering as the main goal of reverse engineering is to reveal the structure or design of a target function instead of approximating it. Therefore, we propose a new type of a function constructing network, called the white box network. This network arranges function blocks to construct a target function to reveal its design. The network uses discretized layers, thus rendering the model interpretable without disordering the function blocks. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end PathNet structure through this discretization by considering the function blocks as neural networks white box, black box, function composition, neural network, ordering functions, reverse engineering, programmable logic controller, plc, white box network, WBN
