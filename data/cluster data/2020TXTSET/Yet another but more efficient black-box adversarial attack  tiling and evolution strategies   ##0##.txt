We introduce a new black-box attack achieving state of the art performances. Our approach is based on a new objective function, borrowing ideas from -white box attacks, and particularly designed to fit derivative-free optimization requirements. It only requires to have access to the logits of the classifier without any other information which is a more realistic scenario. Not only we introduce a new objective function, we extend previous works on black box adversarial attacks to a larger spectrum of evolution strategies and other derivative-free optimization methods. We also highlight a new intriguing property that deep neural networks are not robust to single shot tiled attacks. Our models achieve, with a budget limited to queries, results up to of success rate against InceptionV3 classifier with queries to the network on average in the untargeted attacks setting, which is an improvement by queries of the current state of the art. In the targeted setting, we are able to reach, with a limited budget of , of success rate with a budget of queries on average, i.e. we need queries less than the current state of the art. adversarial examples, black-box attacks, derivative free optimization, deep learning
