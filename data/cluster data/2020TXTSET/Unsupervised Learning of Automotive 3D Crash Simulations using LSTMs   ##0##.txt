Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks allow to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior with feedback connections and seem a natural choice for learning sequences of 3D meshes. We introduce an approach for dynamic mesh representations as used for numerical simulations of car crashes. To bypass the complication of using 3D meshes, we transform the surface mesh sequences into spectral descriptors that efficiently encode the shape. A two branch LSTM based network architecture is chosen to learn the representations and dynamics of the crash during the simulation. The architecture is based on unsupervised video prediction by an LSTM without any convolutional layer. It uses an encoder LSTM to map an input sequence into a fixed length vector representation. On this representation one decoder LSTM performs the reconstruction of the input sequence, while the other decoder LSTM predicts the future behavior by receiving initial steps of the sequence as seed. The spatio-temporal error behavior of the model is analysed to study how well the model can extrapolate the learned spectral descriptors into the future, that is, how well it has learned to represent the underlying dynamical structural mechanics. Considering that only a few training examples are available, which is the typical case for numerical simulations, the network performs very well.
