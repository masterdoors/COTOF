Detecting anomalies is of growing importance for various industrial applications and mission-critical infrastructures, including satellite systems. Although there have been several studies in detecting anomalies based on rule-based or machine learning-based approaches for satellite systems, a tensor-based decomposition method has not been extensively explored for anomaly detection. In this work, we introduce an Integrative Tensor-based Anomaly Detection (ITAD) framework to detect anomalies in a satellite system. Because of the high risk and cost, detecting anomalies in a satellite system is crucial. We construct 3rd-order tensors with telemetry data collected from Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2 (KOMPSAT-2) and calculate the anomaly score using one of the component matrices obtained by applying CANDECOMP PARAFAC decomposition to detect anomalies. Our result shows that our tensor-based approach can be effective in achieving higher accuracy and reducing false positives in detecting anomalies as compared to other existing approaches.
