The dynamics of DNNs during gradient descent is described by the so-called Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). In this article, we show that the NTK allows one to gain precise insight into the Hessian of the cost of DNNs  we obtain a full characterization of the asymptotics of the spectrum of the Hessian, at initialization and during training. theory of deep learning, loss surface, training, fisher information matrix
