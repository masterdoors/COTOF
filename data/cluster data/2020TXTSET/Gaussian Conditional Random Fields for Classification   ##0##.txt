In this paper, a Gaussian conditional random field model for structured binary classification (GCRFBC) is proposed. The model is applicable to classification problems with undirected graphs, intractable for standard classification CRFs. The model representation of GCRFBC is extended by latent variables which yield some appealing properties. Thanks to the GCRF latent structure, the model becomes tractable, efficient, and open to improvements previously applied to GCRF regression. Two different forms of the algorithm are presented  GCRFBCb (GCRGBC - Bayesian) and GCRFBCnb (GCRFBC - non-Bayesian). The extended method of local variational approximation of sigmoid function is used for solving empirical Bayes in GCRFBCb variant, whereas MAP value of latent variables is the basis for learning and inference in the GCRFBCnb variant. The inference in GCRFBCb is solved by Newton-Cotes formulas for one-dimensional integration. Both models are evaluated on synthetic data and real-world data. It was shown that both models achieve better prediction performance than relevant baselines. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed models are discussed.
