We consider the problem of reusing prior experience when an agent is facing a series of Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. We introduce a novel metric between Markov Decision Processes and focus on the study and exploitation of the optimal value function s Lipschitz continuity in the task space with respect to that metric. These theoretical results lead us to a value transfer method for Lifelong RL, which we use to build a PAC-MDP algorithm that exploits continuity to accelerate learning. We illustrate the benefits of the method in Lifelong RL experiments. Reinforcement Learning, Lifelong Learning
