We propose an implementation of GNN that predicts and imitates the motion be- haviors from observed swarm trajectory data. The networkâ€™s ability to capture interaction dynamics in swarms is demonstrated through transfer learning. We finally discuss the inherent availability and challenges in the scalability of GNN, and proposed a method to improve it with layer-wise tuning and mixing of data enabled by padding.
