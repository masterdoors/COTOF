Automatic Piano Fingering is a hard task which computers can learn using data. As data collection is hard and expensive, we propose to automate this process by automatically extracting fingerings from public videos and MIDI files, using computer-vision techniques. Running this process on 90 videos results in the largest dataset for piano fingering with more than 150K notes. We show that when running a previously proposed model for automatic piano fingering on our dataset and then fine-tuning it on manually labeled piano fingering data, we achieve state-of-the-art results. In addition to the fingering extraction method, we also introduce a novel method for transferring deep-learning computer-vision models to work on out-of-domain data, by fine-tuning it on out-of-domain augmentation proposed by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). For demonstration, we anonymously release a visualization of the output of our process for a single video on https   youtu.be Gfs1UWQhr5Q piano, fingering, dataset
