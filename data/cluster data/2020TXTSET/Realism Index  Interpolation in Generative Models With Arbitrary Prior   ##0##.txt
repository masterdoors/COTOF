In order to perform plausible interpolations in the latent space of a generative model, we need a measure that credibly reflects if a point in an interpolation is close to the data manifold being modelled, i.e. if it is convincing. In this paper, we introduce a realism index of a point, which can be constructed from an arbitrary prior density, or based on FID score approach in case a prior is not available. We propose a numerically efficient algorithm that directly maximises the realism index of an interpolation which, as we theoretically prove, leads to a search of a geodesic with respect to the corresponding Riemann structure. We show that we obtain better interpolations then the classical linear ones, in particular when either the prior density is not convex shaped, or when the soap bubble effect appears.
