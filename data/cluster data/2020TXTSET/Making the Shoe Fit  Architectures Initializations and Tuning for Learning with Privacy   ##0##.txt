Because learning sometimes involves sensitive data, standard machine-learning algorithms have been extended to offer strong privacy guarantees for training data. However, in practice, this has been mostly an afterthought, with privacy-preserving models obtained by re-running training with a different optimizer, but using the same model architecture that performed well in a non-privacy-preserving setting. This approach leads to less than ideal privacy utility tradeoffs, as we show here. Instead, we propose that model architectures and initializations are chosen and hyperparameter tuning is performed, ab initio, explicitly for privacy-preserving training. Using this paradigm, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10 without any modification of the fundamental learning procedures or differential-privacy analysis. differential privacy, deep learning
