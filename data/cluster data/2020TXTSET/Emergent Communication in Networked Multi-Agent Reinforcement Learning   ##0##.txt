With the ever increasing demand and the resultant reduced quality of services, the focus has shifted towards easing network congestion to enable more efficient flow in systems like traffic, supply chains and electrical grids. A step in this direction is to re-imagine the traditional heuristics based training of systems as this approach is incapable of modelling the involved dynamics. While one can apply Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to such problems by considering each vertex in the network as an agent, most MARL-based models assume the agents to be independent. In many real-world tasks, agents need to behave as a group, rather than as a collection of individuals. In this paper, we propose a framework that induces cooperation and coordination amongst agents, connected via an underlying network, using emergent communication in a MARL-based setup. We formulate the problem in a general network setting and demonstrate the utility of communication in networks with the help of a case study on traffic systems. Furthermore, we study the emergent communication protocol and show the formation of distinct communities with grounded vocabulary. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that studies emergent language in a networked MARL setting. emergent communication, multi-agent reinforcement learning
