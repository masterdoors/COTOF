We introduce Lyceum, a high-performance computational ecosystem for robotlearning. Lyceum is built on top of the Julia programming language and theMuJoCo physics simulator, combining the ease-of-use of a high-level program-ming language with the performance of native C. Lyceum is up to 10-20Xfaster compared to other popular abstractions like OpenAI’sGymand Deep-Mind’sdm-control. This substantially reduces training time for various re-inforcement learning algorithms; and is also fast enough to support real-timemodel predictive control with physics simulators. Lyceum has a straightfor-ward API and supports parallel computation across multiple cores or machines.The code base, tutorials, and demonstration videos can be found at  https   sites.google.com view lyceum-anon.
