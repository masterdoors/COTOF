We re-think the Two-Player Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an instance of a distribution sampling problem in infinite dimensions. Using the powerful Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, we propose a new two-player RL algorithm, which is a sampling variant of the two-player policy gradient method. Our new algorithm consistently outperforms existing baselines, in terms of generalization across differing training and testing conditions, on several MuJoCo environments. deep reinforcement learning, robust reinforcement learning, min-max problem
