Bitcoin is a virtual coinage system that enables users to trade virtually free of a central trusted authority. All transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are publicly available for viewing, yet as Bitcoin is built mainly for security itâ€™s original structure does not allow for direct analysis of address transactions. Existing analysis methods of the Bitcoin blockchain can be complicated, computationally expensive or inaccurate. We propose a computationally efficient model to analyze bitcoin blockchain addresses and allow for their use with existing machine learning algorithms. We compare our approach against Multi Level Sequence Learners (MLSLs), one of the best performing models on bitcoin address data. crypto-currency, bitcoin, blockchain, 2vec
