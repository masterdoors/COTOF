Deep learning models are often sensitive to adversarial attacks, where carefully-designed input samples can cause the system to produce incorrect decisions. Here we focus on the problem of detecting attacks, rather than robust classification, since detecting that an attack occurs may be even more important than avoiding misclassification. We build on advances in explainability, where activity-map-like explanations are used to justify and validate decisions, by highlighting features that are involved with a classification decision. The key observation is that it is hard to create explanations for incorrect decisions. We propose EXAID, a novel attack-detection approach, which uses model explainability to identify images whose explanations are inconsistent with the predicted class. Specifically, we use SHAP, which uses Shapley values in the space of the input image, to identify which input features contribute to a class decision. Interestingly, this approach does not require to modify the attacked model, and it can be applied without modelling a specific attack. It can therefore be applied successfully to detect unfamiliar attacks, that were unknown at the time the detection model was designed. We evaluate EXAID on two benchmark datasets CIFAR-10 and SVHN, and against three leading attack techniques, FGSM, PGD and C&W. We find that EXAID improves over the SoTA detection methods by a large margin across a wide range of noise levels, improving detection from 70% to over 90% for small perturbations. adversarial, detection, explainability
