Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in various applications due to their strong expressive power. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are manipulated instances targeting to mislead DNNs to make incorrect predictions. Currently, most such adversarial examples try to guarantee “subtle perturbation  by limiting the Lp norm of the perturbation. In this paper, we aim to explore the impact of semantic manipulation on DNNs predictions by manipulating the semantic attributes of images and generate “unrestricted adversarial examples . Such semantic based perturbation is more practical compared with the Lp bounded perturbation. In particular, we propose an algorithm SemanticAdv which leverages disentangled semantic factors to generate adversarial perturbation by altering controlled semantic attributes to fool the learner towards various “adversarial  targets. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the semantic based adversarial examples can not only fool different learning tasks such as face verification and landmark detection, but also achieve high targeted attack success rate against real-world black-box services such as Azure face verification service based on transferability. To further demonstrate the applicability of SemanticAdv beyond face recognition domain, we also generate semantic perturbations on street-view images. Such adversarial examples with controlled semantic manipulation can shed light on further understanding about vulnerabilities of DNNs as well as potential defensive approaches. adversarial examples, semantic attack
