We investigate methods for semi-supervised learning (SSL) of a neural linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) by treating the tagger as the amortized variational posterior in a generative model of text given tags. We first illustrate how to incorporate a CRF in a VAE, enabling end-to-end training on semi-supervised data. We then investigate a series of increasingly complex deep generative models of tokens given tags enabled by end-to-end optimization, comparing the proposed models against supervised and strong CRF SSL baselines on the Ontonotes5 NER dataset. We find that our best proposed model consistently improves performance by F1 in low- and moderate-resource regimes and easily addresses degenerate model behavior in a more difficult, partially supervised setting. vae, ner, tagging, crf, nlp, semi-supervised learning
