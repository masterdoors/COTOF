High intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity is a characteristic of remote sensing scene image data sets currently posing significant difficulty for deep learning algorithms on classification tasks. To improve accuracy, post-classification methods have been proposed for smoothing results of model predictions. However, those approaches require an additional neural network to perform the smoothing operation, which adds overhead to the task. We propose an approach that involves learning deep features directly over neighboring scene images without requiring use of a cleanup model. Our approach utilizes a siamese network to improve the discriminative power of convolutional neural networks on a pair of neighboring scene images. It then exploits semantic coherence between this pair to enrich the feature vector of the image for which we want to predict a label. Empirical results show that this approach provides a viable alternative to existing methods. For example, our model improved prediction accuracy by 1 percentage point and dropped the mean squared error value by 0.02 over the baseline, on a disease density estimation task. These performance gains are comparable with results from existing post-classification methods, moreover without implementation overheads. semantic coherence, satellite scene image analysis, convolutional neural networks, disease density
