We introduce a method to create Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) for a given CNN in a data-free manner. Data-free approaches suite scenarios where the original training data is unavailable for crafting adversaries. We show that the adversary generation with full training data can be approximated to a formulation without data. This is realized through a sequential optimization of the adversarial perturbation with the proposed dilate loss. Dilate loss basically maximizes the Euclidean norm of the output before nonlinearity at any layer. By doing so, the perturbation constrains the ReLU activation function at every layer to act roughly linear for data points and thus eliminate the dependency on data for crafting UAPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only has theoretical support, but achieves higher fooling rate than the existing data-free work. Furthermore, we evidence improvement in limited data cases as well.
