A general problem that received considerable recent attention is how to perform multiple tasks in the same network, maximizing both efficiency and prediction accuracy. A popular approach consists of a multi-branch architecture on top of a shared backbone, jointly trained on a weighted sum of losses. However, in many cases, the shared representation results in non-optimal performance, mainly due to an interference between conflicting gradients of uncorrelated tasks. Recent approaches address this problem by a channel-wise modulation of the feature-maps along the shared backbone, with task specific vectors, manually or dynamically tuned. Taking this approach a step further, we propose a novel architecture which modulate the recognition network channel-wise, as well as spatial-wise, with an efficient top-down image-dependent computation scheme. Our architecture uses no task-specific branches, nor task specific modules. Instead, it uses a top-down modulation network that is shared between all of the tasks. We show the effectiveness of our scheme by achieving on par or better results than alternative approaches on both correlated and uncorrelated sets of tasks. We also demonstrate our advantages in terms of model size, the addition of novel tasks and interpretability. Code will be released. deep learning, multi-task learning
