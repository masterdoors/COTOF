Despite having excellent performances for a wide variety of tasks, modern neural networks are unable to provide a prediction with a reliable confidence estimate which would allow to detect misclassifications. This limitation is at the heart of what is known as an adversarial example, where the network provides a wrong prediction associated with a strong confidence to a slightly modified image. Moreover, this overconfidence issue has also been observed for out-of-distribution data. We show through several experiments that the softmax activation, usually placed as the last layer of modern neural networks, is partly responsible for this behaviour. We give qualitative insights about its impact on the MNIST dataset, showing that relevant information present in the logits is lost once the softmax function is applied. The same observation is made through quantitative analysis, as we show that two out-of-distribution and adversarial example detectors obtain competitive results when using logit values as inputs, but provide considerably lower performances if they use softmax probabilities instead  from 98.0% average AUROC to 56.8% in some settings. These results provide evidence that the softmax activation hinders the detection of adversarial and out-of-distribution examples, as it masks a significant part of the relevant information present in the logits.
