In this paper we present a deep Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) method that can be trained end-to-end to perform classification from weak supervision. Our MIL method is implemented as a two stream neural network, specialized in tasks of instance classification and weighting. Our instance weighting stream makes use of Gaussian radial basis function to normalize the instance weights by comparing instances locally within the bag and globally across bags. The final classification score of the bag is an aggregate of all instance classification scores. The instance representation is shared by both instance classification and weighting streams. The Gaussian instance weighting allows us to regularize the representation learning of instances such that all positive instances to be closer to each other w.r.t. the instance weighting function. We evaluate our method on five standard MIL datasets and show that our method outperforms other MIL methods. We also evaluate our model on two datasets where all models are trained end-to-end. Our method obtain better bag-classification and instance classification results on these datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to investigate the robustness of the proposed model and obtain interesting insights. Multiple instance learning, deep learning
