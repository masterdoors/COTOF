In recent years several adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed. Often seemingly robust models turn out to be non-robust when more sophisticated attacks are used. One way out of this dilemma are provable robustness guarantees. While provably robust models for specific -perturbation models have been developed, we show that they do not come with any guarantee against other -perturbations. We propose a new regularization scheme, MMR-Universal, for ReLU networks which enforces robustness wrt - 	extit{and} -perturbations and show how that leads to the first provably robust models wrt any -norm for . adversarial robustness, provable guarantees
