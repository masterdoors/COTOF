Controlled generation of text is of high practical use. Recent efforts have made impressive progress in generating or editing sentences with given textual attributes (e.g., sentiment). This work studies a new practical setting of text content manipulation. Given a structured record, such as (PLAYER  Lebron, POINTS  20, ASSISTS  10), and a reference sentence, such as Kobe easily dropped 30 points, we aim to generate a sentence that accurately describes the full content in the record, with the same writing style (e.g., wording, transitions) of the reference. The problem combines the characteristics of data-to-text generation and style transfer, and is challenging to minimally yet effectively manipulate the text (by rewriting adding deleting text portions) to ensure fidelity to the structured content. We derive two datasets from the data-to-text task as our testbed, and develop a neural method with weakly supervised competing objectives and explicit content coverage constraints. Automatic and human evaluations show superiority of our approach over competitive methods including a strong rule-based baseline and prior approaches designed for style transfer.
