Image paragraph captioning is the task of automatically generating multiple sentences for describing images in grain-fined and coherent text. Existing typical deep learning-based models for image captioning consist of an image encoder to extract visual features and a language model decoder, which has shown promising results in single high-level sentence generation. However, only the word-level scalar guiding signal is available when the image encoder is optimized to extract visual features. The inconsistency between the parallel extraction of visual features and sequential text supervision limits its success when the length of the generated text is long (more than 50 words). In this paper, we propose a new module, called the Text Embedding Bank (TEB) module, to address the problem for image paragraph captioning. This module uses the paragraph vector model to learn fixed-length feature representations from a variable-length paragraph. We refer to the fixed-length feature as the TEB. This TEB module plays two roles to benefit paragraph captioning performance. First, it acts as a form of global and coherent deep supervision to regularize visual feature extraction in the image encoder. Second, it acts as a distributed memory to provide features of the whole paragraph to the language model, which alleviating the long-term dependency problem. Adding this module to two existing state-of-the-art methods achieves a new state-of-the-art result by a large margin on the paragraph captioning Visual Genome dataset. caption, text embedding
