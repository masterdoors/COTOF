We propose a novel method for compressed sensing recovery using untrained deep generative models. Our method is based on the recently proposed Deep Image Prior (DIP), wherein the convolutional weights of the network are optimized to match the observed measurements. We show that this approach can be applied to solve any differentiable linear inverse problem, outperforming previous unlearned methods. Unlike various learned approaches based on generative models, our method does not require pre-training over large datasets. We further introduce a novel learned regularization technique, which incorporates prior information on the network weights. This reduces reconstruction error, especially for noisy measurements. Finally we prove that, using the DIP optimization approach, moderately overparameterized single-layer networks trained can perfectly fit any signal despite the nonconvex nature of the fitting problem. This theoretical result provides justification for early stopping. compressed sensing, sparsity, inverse problems
