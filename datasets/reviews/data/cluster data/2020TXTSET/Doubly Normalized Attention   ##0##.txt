Models based on the Transformer architecture have achieved better accuracy than models based on competing architectures. A unique feature of the Transformer is its universal application of a self-attention mechanism, which allows for free information flow at arbitrary distances. In this paper, we provide two alternative views of the attention mechanism  one from the probabilistic view via the Gaussian mixture model, the other from the optimization view via optimal transport. Following these insights, we propose a new attention scheme that requires normalization on both the upper and lower layers, called the doubly-normalized attention scheme. We analyze the properties of both the original and the new attention schemes, and find that the doubly-normalized attention mechanism directly mitigates two unwanted effects  it resolves the explaining-away effect and alleviates mode collapse. We conduct empirical studies that quantify numerical advantages for the doubly-normalized attention model, as well as for a hybrid model that dynamically combines both attention schemes to achieve improved performance on several well-known benchmarks.
