Network structures are important to learning good representations of many tasks in computer vision and machine learning communities. These structures are either manually designed, or searched by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in previous works, which however requires either expert-level efforts, or prohibitive computational cost. In practice, it is desirable to efficiently and simultaneously learn both the structures and parameters of a network from arbitrary classes with budgeted computational cost. We identify it as a new learning paradigm -- Boosting Network, where one starts from simple models, delving into complex trained models progressively. In this paper, by virtue of an iterative sparse regularization path -- Split Linearized Bregman Iteration (SplitLBI), we propose a simple yet effective boosting network method that can simultaneously grow and train a network by progressively adding both convolutional filters and layers. Extensive experiments with VGG and ResNets validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.
