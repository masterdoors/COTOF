Identifying anomalous samples from highly complex and unstructured data is a crucial but challenging task in a variety of intelligent systems. In this paper, we present a novel deep anomaly detection framework named AnoDM (standing for Anomaly detection based on unsupervised Disentangled representation learning and Manifold learning). The disentanglement learning is currently implemented by beta-VAE for automatically discovering interpretable factorized latent representations in a completely unsupervised manner. The manifold learning is realized by t-SNE for projecting the latent representations to a 2D map. We define a new anomaly score function by combining beta-VAE s reconstruction error in the raw feature space and local density estimation in the t-SNE space. AnoDM was evaluated on both image and time-series data and achieved better results than models that use just one of the two measures and other deep learning methods. anomaly detection, disentangled representation learning, manifold learning
