Generative Adversarial Networks have been shown to be powerful tools for generating content resulting in them being intensively studied in recent years. Training these networks requires maximizing a generator loss and minimizing a discriminator loss, leading to a difficult saddle point problem that is slow and difficult to converge. Motivated by techniques in the registration of point clouds and the fluid flow formulation of mass transport, we investigate a new formulation that is based on strict minimization, without the need for the maximization. This formulation views the problem as a matching problem rather than an adversarial one, and thus allows us to quickly converge and obtain meaningful metrics in the optimization path. generative network, optimal mass transport, gaussian mixture, model matching
