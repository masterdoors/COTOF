In many real-world settings, a learning model must perform few-shot classification  learn to classify examples from unseen classes using only a few labeled examples per class. Additionally, to be safely deployed, it should have the ability to detect out-of-distribution inputs  examples that do not belong to any of the classes. While both few-shot classification and out-of-distribution detection are popular topics, their combination has not been studied. In this work, we propose tasks for out-of-distribution detection in the few-shot setting and establish benchmark datasets, based on four popular few-shot classification datasets. Then, we propose two new methods for this task and investigate their performance. In sum, we establish baseline out-of-distribution detection results using standard metrics on new benchmark datasets and show improved results with our proposed methods. few-shot classification, out-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimate
