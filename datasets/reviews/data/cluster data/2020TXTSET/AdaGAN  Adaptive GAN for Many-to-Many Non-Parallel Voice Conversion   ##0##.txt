Voice Conversion (VC) is a task of converting perceived speaker identity from a source speaker to a particular target speaker. Earlier approaches in the literature primarily find a mapping between the given source-target speaker-pairs. Developing mapping techniques for many-to-many VC using non-parallel data, including zero-shot learning remains less explored areas in VC. Most of the many-to-many VC architectures require training data from all the target speakers for whom we want to convert the voices. In this paper, we propose a novel style transfer architecture, which can also be extended to generate voices even for target speakers whose data were not used in the training (i.e., case of zero-shot learning). In particular, propose Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network (AdaGAN), new architectural training procedure help in learning normalized speaker-independent latent representation, which will be used to generate speech with different speaking styles in the context of VC. We compare our results with the state-of-the-art StarGAN-VC architecture. In particular, the AdaGAN achieves 31.73%, and 10.37% relative improvement compared to the StarGAN in MOS tests for speech quality and speaker similarity, respectively. The key strength of the proposed architectures is that it yields these results with less computational complexity. AdaGAN is 88.6% less complex than StarGAN-VC in terms of FLoating Operation Per Second (FLOPS), and 85.46% less complex in terms of trainable parameters.
