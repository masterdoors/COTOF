Clustering algorithms have wide applications and play an important role in data analysis fields including time series data analysis. The performance of a clustering algorithm depends on the features extracted from the data. However, in time series analysis, there has been a problem that the conventional methods based on the signal shape are unstable for phase shift, amplitude and signal length variations. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm focused on the dynamical system aspect of the signal using recurrent neural network and variational Bayes method. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm has a robustness against above variations and boost the classification performance.
