Bayesian inference is used extensively to quantify the uncertainty in an inferred field given the measurement of a related field when the two are linked by a mathematical model. Despite its many applications, Bayesian inference faces challenges when inferring fields that have discrete representations of large dimension, and or have prior distributions that are difficult to characterize mathematically. In this work we demonstrate how the approximate distribution learned by a generative adversarial network (GAN) may be used as a prior in a Bayesian update to address both these challenges. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by inferring and quantifying uncertainty in inference problems arising in computer vision and physics-based applications. In both instances we highlight the role of computing uncertainty in providing a measure of confidence in the solution, and in designing successive measurements to improve this confidence.
