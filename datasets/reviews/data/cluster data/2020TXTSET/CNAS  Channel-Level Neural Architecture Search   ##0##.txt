There is growing interest in automating designing good neural network architectures. The NAS methods proposed recently have significantly reduced architecture search cost by sharing parameters, but there is still a challenging problem of designing search space. We consider search space is typically defined with its shape and a set of operations and propose a channel-level architecture search,(CNAS) method using only a fixed type of operation. The resulting architecture is sparse in terms of channel and has different topology at different cell. The experimental results for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that a fine-granular and sparse model searched by CNAS achieves very competitive performance with dense models searched by the existing methods.
