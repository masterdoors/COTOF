This paper shows that deep learning (DL) representations of data produced by generative adversarial nets (GANs) are random vectors which fall within the class of so-called concentrated random vectors. Further exploiting the fact that Gram matrices, of the type G = X X with X = [x_1 , . . . , x_n ]   R p√ón and x_i independent concentrated random vectors from a mixture model, behave asymptotically (as n, p    ) as if the x_i were drawn from a Gaussian mixture, suggests that DL representations of GAN-data can be fully described by their first two statistical moments for a wide range of standard classifiers. Our theoretical findings are validated by generating images with the BigGAN model and across different popular deep representation networks. Random Matrix Theory, Deep Learning Representations, GANs
