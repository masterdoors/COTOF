Energy based models outputs unmormalized log-probability values given datasamples. Such a estimation is essential in a variety of application problems suchas sample generation, denoising, sample restoration, outlier detection, Bayesianreasoning, and many more. However, standard maximum likelihood training iscomputationally expensive due to the requirement of sampling model distribution.Score matching potentially alleviates this problem, and denoising score matching(Vincent, 2011) is a particular convenient version. However, previous attemptsfailed to produce models capable of high quality sample synthesis. We believethat it is because they only performed denoising score matching over a singlenoise scale. To overcome this limitation, here we instead learn an energy functionusing all noise scales. When sampled using Annealed Langevin dynamics andsingle step denoising jump, our model produced high-quality samples comparableto state-of-the-art techniques such as GANs, in addition to assigning likelihood totest data comparable to previous likelihood models. Our model set a new sam-ple quality baseline in likelihood-based models. We further demonstrate that our model learns sample distribution and generalize well on an image inpainting tasks.
