Graph Neural Networks as a combination of Graph Signal Processing and Deep Convolutional Networks shows great power in pattern recognition in non-Euclidean domains. In this paper, we propose a new method to deploy two pipelines based on the duality of a graph to improve accuracy. By exploring the primal graph and its dual graph where nodes and edges can be treated as one another, we have exploited the benefits of both vertex features and edge features. As a result, we have arrived at a framework that has great potential in both semisupervised and unsupervised learning. Graph, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, semi-supervised learning
