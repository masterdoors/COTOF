In this work we present an approach that combines deep learning together with laws of Newton’s physics for accurate trajectory predictions in physical games. Our model learns to estimate physical properties and forces that generated given observations, learns the relationships between available player’s actions and estimated physical properties and uses these extracted forces for predictions. We show the advantages of using physical laws together with deep learning by evaluating it against two baseline models that automatically discover features from the data without such a knowledge. We evaluate our model abilities to extract physical properties and to generalize to unseen trajectories in two games with a shooting mechanism. We also evaluate our model capabilities to transfer learned knowledge from a 2D game for predictions in a 3D game with a similar physics. We show that by using physical laws together with deep learning we achieve a better human-interpretability of learned physical properties, transfer of knowledge to a game with similar physics and very accurate predictions for previously unseen data.
