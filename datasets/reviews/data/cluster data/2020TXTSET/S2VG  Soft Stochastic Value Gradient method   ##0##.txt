Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown its advantages in sample-efficiency over model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Despite the impressive results it achieves, it still faces a trade-off between the ease of data generation and model bias. In this paper, we propose a simple and elegant model-based reinforcement learning algorithm called soft stochastic value gradient method (S2VG). S2VG combines the merits of the maximum-entropy reinforcement learning and MBRL, and exploits both real and imaginary data. In particular, we embed the model in the policy training and learn and functions from the real (or imaginary) data set. Such embedding enables us to compute an analytic policy gradient through the back-propagation rather than the likelihood-ratio estimation, which can reduce the variance of the gradient estimation. We name our algorithm Soft Stochastic Value Gradient method to indicate its connection with the well-known stochastic value gradient method in citep{heess2015Learning}.
