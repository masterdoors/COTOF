Many practical robot locomotion tasks require agents to use control policies that can be parameterized by goals. Popular deep reinforcement learning approaches in this direction involve learning goal-conditioned policies or value functions, or Inverse Dynamics Models (IDMs). IDMs map an agentâ€™s current state and desired goal to the required actions. We show that the key to achieving good performance with IDMs lies in learning the information shared between equivalent experiences, so that they can be generalized to unseen scenarios. We design a training process that guides the learning of latent representations to encode this shared information. Using a limited number of environment interactions, our agent is able to efficiently navigate to arbitrary points in the goal space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in high-dimensional locomotion environments such as the Mujoco Ant, PyBullet Humanoid, and PyBullet Minitaur. We provide quantitative and qualitative results to show that our method clearly outperforms competing baseline approaches. deep reinforcement learning, continuous control, inverse dynamics model
