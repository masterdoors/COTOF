Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved great success at generating realistic samples. However, achieving disentangled and controllable generation still remains challenging for GANs, especially in the high-resolution image domain. Motivated by this, we introduce AC-StyleGAN, a combination of AC-GAN and StyleGAN, for demonstrating that the controllable generation of high-resolution images is possible with sufficient supervision. More importantly, only using 5% of the labelled data significantly improves the disentanglement quality. Inspired by the observed separation of fine and coarse styles in StyleGAN, we then extend AC-StyleGAN to a new image-to-image model called FC-StyleGAN for semantic manipulation of fine-grained factors in a high-resolution image. In experiments, we show that FC-StyleGAN performs well in only controlling fine-grained factors, with the use of instance normalization, and also demonstrate its good generalization ability to unseen images. Finally, we create two new datasets -- Falcor3D and Isaac3D with higher resolution, more photorealism, and richer variation, as compared to existing disentanglement datasets.
