We argue that symmetry is an important consideration in addressing the problem of systematicity and investigate two forms of symmetry relevant to symbolic processes. We implement this approach in terms of convolution and show that it can be used to achieve effective generalisation in three toy problems  rule learning, composition and grammar learning. symmetry, systematicity, convolution, symbols, generalisation
