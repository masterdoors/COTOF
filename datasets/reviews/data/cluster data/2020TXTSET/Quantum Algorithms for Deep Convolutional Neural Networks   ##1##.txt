Quantum computing is a powerful computational paradigm with applications in several fields, including machine learning. In the last decade, deep learning, and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have become essential for applications in signal processing and image recognition. Quantum deep learning, however, remains a challenging problem, as it is difficult to implement non linearities with quantum unitaries. In this paper we propose a quantum algorithm for evaluating and training deep convolutional neural networks with potential speedups over classical CNNs for both the forward and backward passes. The quantum CNN (QCNN) reproduces completely the outputs of the classical CNN and allows for non linearities and pooling operations. The QCNN is in particular interesting for deep networks and could allow new frontiers in the image recognition domain, by allowing for many more convolution kernels, larger kernels, high dimensional inputs and high depth input channels. We also present numerical simulations for the classification of the MNIST dataset to provide practical evidence for the efficiency of the QCNN. quantum computing, quantum machine learning, convolutional neural network, theory, algorithm
