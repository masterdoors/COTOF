In geometric computer vision applications, multi-image feature matching gives more accurate and robust solutions compared to simple two-image matching. In this work, we formulate multi-image matching as a graph embedding problem, then use a Graph Neural Network to learn an appropriate embedding function for aligning image features. We use cycle consistency to train our network in an unsupervised fashion, since ground truth correspondence can be difficult or expensive to acquire. Geometric consistency losses are added to aid training, though unlike optimization based methods no geometric information is necessary at inference time. To the best of our knowledge, no other works have used graph neural networks for multi-image feature matching. Our experiments show that our method is competitive with other optimization based approaches. Graph Neural Networks, Multi-image Matching
