We propose a potential flow generator with optimal transport regularity, which can be easily integrated into a wide range of generative models including different versions of GANs and flow-based models. With up to a slight augmentation of the original generator loss functions, our generator is not only a transport map from the input distribution to the target one, but also the one with minimum transport cost. We show the correctness and robustness of the potential flow generator in several 2D problems, and illustrate the concept of ``proximity   due to the optimal transport regularity. Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the potential flow generator in image translation tasks with unpaired training data from the MNIST dataset and the CelebA dataset. generative models, optimal transport, GANs, flow-based models
