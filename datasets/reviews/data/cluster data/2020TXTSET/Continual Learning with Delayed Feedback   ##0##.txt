Most of the artificial neural networks are using the benefit of labeled datasets whereas in human brain, the learning is often unsupervised. The feedback or a label for a given input or a sensory stimuli is not often available instantly. After some time when brain gets the feedback, it updates its knowledge. That s how brain learns. Moreover, there is no training or testing phase. Human learns continually. This work proposes a model-agnostic continual learning framework which can be used with neural networks as well as decision trees to incorporate continual learning. Specifically, this work investigates how delayed feedback can be handled. In addition, a way to update the Machine Learning models with unlabeled data is proposed. Promising results are received from the experiments done on neural networks and decision trees.
