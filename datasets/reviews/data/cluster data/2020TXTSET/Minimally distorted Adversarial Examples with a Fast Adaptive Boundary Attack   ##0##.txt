The evaluation of robustness against adversarial manipulations of neural networks-based classifiers is mainly tested with empirical attacks as the methods for the exact computation, even when available, do not scale to large networks. We propose in this paper a new white-box adversarial attack wrt the -norms for aiming at finding the minimal perturbation necessary to change the class of a given input. It has an intuitive geometric meaning, yields quickly high quality results, minimizes the size of the perturbation (so that it returns the robust accuracy at every threshold with a single run). It performs better or similarly to state-of-the-art attacks which are partially specialized to one -norm. adversarial attacks, adversarial robustness
