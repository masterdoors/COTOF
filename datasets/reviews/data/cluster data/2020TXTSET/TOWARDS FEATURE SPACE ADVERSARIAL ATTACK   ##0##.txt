We propose a new type of adversarial attack to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for image classification. Different from most existing attacks that directly perturb input pixels. Our attack focuses on perturbing abstract features, more specifically, features that denote styles, including interpretable styles such as vivid colors and sharp outlines, and uninterpretable ones. It induces model misclassfication by injecting style changes insensitive for humans, through an optimization procedure. We show that state-of-the-art pixel space adversarial attack detection and defense techniques are ineffective in guarding against feature space attacks.
