In this paper, we present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which performs arbitrary resize operation on intermediate feature map resolution at stage-level. Motivated by weight sharing mechanism in neural architecture search, where a super-network is trained and sub-networks inherit the weights from the super-network, we present a novel CNN approach. We construct a spatial super-network which consists of multiple sub-networks, where each sub-network is a single scale network that obtain a unique spatial configuration, the convolutional layers are shared across all sub-networks. Such network, named as Resizable Neural Networks, are equivalent to training infinite single scale networks, but has no extra computational cost. Moreover, we present a training algorithm such that all sub-networks achieve better performance than individually trained counterparts. On large-scale ImageNet classification, we demonstrate its effectiveness on various modern network architectures such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and ResNet. To go even further, we present three variants of resizable networks  1) Resizable as Architecture Search (Resizable-NAS). On ImageNet, Resizable-NAS ResNet-50 attain 0.4% higher on accuracy and 44% smaller than the baseline model. 2) Resizable as Data Augmentation (Resizable-Aug). While we use resizable networks as a data augmentation technique, it obtains superior performance on ImageNet classification, outperform AutoAugment by 1.2% with ResNet-50. 3) Adaptive Resizable Network (Resizable-Adapt). We introduce the adaptive resizable networks as dynamic networks, which further improve the performance with less computational cost via data-dependent inference.
