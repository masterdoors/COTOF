We introduce the notion of property signatures, a representation for programs and program specifications meant for consumption by machine learning algorithms. Given a function with input type  _in and output type  _out, a property is a function of type  ( _in,  _out)   Bool that (informally) describes some simple property of the function under consideration. For instance, if  _in and  _out are both lists of the same type, one property might ask ‘is the input list the same length as the output list ’. If we have a list of such properties, we can evaluate them all for our function to get a list of outputs that we will call the property signature. Crucially, we can ‘guess’ the property signature for a function given only a set of input output pairs meant to specify that function. We discuss several potential applications of property signatures and show experimentally that they can be used to improve over a baseline synthesizer so that it emits twice as many programs in less than one-tenth of the time.
