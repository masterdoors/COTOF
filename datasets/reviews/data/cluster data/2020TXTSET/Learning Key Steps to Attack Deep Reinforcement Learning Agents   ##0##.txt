Deep reinforcement learning agents are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, recent studies have shown that attacking a few key steps is effective for decreasing the agent s cumulative reward. However, all existing attacking methods find those key steps with human-designed heuristics, and it is not clear how more effective key steps can be identified. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework that learns more effective key steps through interacting with the agent. The proposed framework does not require any human heuristics nor knowledge, and can be flexibly coupled with any white-box or black-box adversarial attack scenarios. Experiments on benchmark Atari games across different scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework is superior to existing methods for identifying more effective key steps. deep reinforcement learning, adversarial attacks
