Likelihood from a generative model is a natural statistic for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. However, generative models have been shown to assign higher likelihood to OoD samples compared to ones from the training distribution, preventing simple threshold-based detection rules. We demonstrate that OoD detection fails even when using more sophisticated statistics based on the likelihoods of individual samples. To address these issues, we propose a new method that leverages batch normalization. We argue that batch normalization for generative models challenges the traditional emph{i.i.d.} data assumption and changes the corresponding maximum likelihood objective. Based on this insight, we propose to exploit in-batch dependencies for OoD detection. Empirical results suggest that this leads to more robust detection for high-dimensional images.
