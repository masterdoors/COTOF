Improving the sample efficiency in reinforcement learning has been a long-standing research problem. In this work, we aim to reduce the sample complexity of existing policy gradient methods. We propose a novel policy gradient algorithm called SRVR-PG, which only requires footnote{ notation hides constant factors.} episodes to find an -approximate stationary point of the nonconcave performance function (i.e., such that ). This sample complexity improves the existing result for stochastic variance reduced policy gradient algorithms by a factor of . In addition, we also propose a variant of SRVR-PG with parameter exploration, which explores the initial policy parameter from a prior probability distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on classic control problems in reinforcement learning to validate the performance of our proposed algorithms.
