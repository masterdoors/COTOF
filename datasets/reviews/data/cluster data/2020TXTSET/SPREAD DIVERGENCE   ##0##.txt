For distributions and with different supports, the divergence may not exist. We define a spread divergence on modified and and describe sufficient conditions for the existence of such a divergence. We demonstrate how to maximize the discriminatory power of a given divergence by parameterizing and learning the spread. We also give examples of using a spread divergence to train and improve implicit generative models, including linear models (Independent Components Analysis) and non-linear models (Deep Generative Networks). divergence minimization, generative model, variational inference
