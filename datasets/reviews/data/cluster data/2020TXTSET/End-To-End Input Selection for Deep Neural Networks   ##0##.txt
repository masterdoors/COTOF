Data have often to be moved between servers and clients during the inference phase. This is the case, for instance, when large amounts of data are stored on a public storage server without the possibility for the users to directly execute code and, hence, apply machine learning models. Depending on the available bandwidth, this data transfer can become a major bottleneck. We propose a simple yet effective framework that allows to select certain parts of the input data needed for the subsequent application of a given neural network. Both the associated selection masks as well as the neural network are trained simultaneously such that a good model performance is achieved while, at the same time, only a minimal amount of data is selected. During the inference phase, only the parts selected by the masks have to be transferred between the server and the client. Our experiments indicate that it is often possible to significantly reduce the amount of data needed to be transferred without affecting the model performance much.
