We study the convergence of gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training -hidden-layer linear residual networks (ResNets). We prove that for training deep residual networks with certain linear transformations at input and output layers, which are fixed throughout training, both GD and SGD with zero initialization on all hidden weights can converge to the global minimum of the training loss. Moreover, when specializing to appropriate Gaussian random linear transformations, GD and SGD provably optimize wide enough deep linear ResNets. Compared with the global convergence result of GD for training standard deep linear networks citep{du2019width}, our condition on the neural network width is sharper by a factor of , where denotes the condition number of the covariance matrix of the training data. In addition, for the first time we establish the global convergence of SGD for training deep linear ResNets and prove a linear convergence rate when the global minimum is .
