Global solutions to high-dimensional sparse estimation problems with a folded concave penalty (FCP) have been shown to be statistically desirable but are strongly NP-hard to compute, which implies the non-existence of a pseudo-polynomial time global optimization schemes in the worst case. This paper shows that, with high probability, a global solution to the formulation for a FCP-based high-dimensional generalized linear model coincides with a stationary point characterized by the significant subspace second order necessary conditions (S ONC). Since the desired S ONC solution admits a fully polynomial-time approximation schemes (FPTAS), we thus have shown the existence of fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for a strongly NP-hard problem. We further demonstrate two versions of the FPRAS for generating the desired S ONC solutions. One follows the paradigm of an interior point trust region algorithm and the other is the well-studied local linear approximation (LLA). Our analysis thus provides new techniques for global optimization of certain NP-Hard problems and new insights on the effectiveness of LLA. statistical learning, FPRAS, global optimization, folded concave penalty, GLM, high dimensional learning
