State of the art visual relation detection methods mostly rely on object information extracted from RGB images such as predicted class probabilities, 2D bounding boxes and feature maps. In this paper, we argue that the 3D positions of objects in space can provide additional valuable information about object relations. This information helps not only to detect spatial relations, such as 	extit{standing behind}, but also non-spatial relations, such as 	extit{holding}. Since 3D information of a scene is not easily accessible, we propose incorporating a pre-trained RGB-to-Depth model within visual relation detection frameworks. We discuss different feature extraction strategies from depth maps and show their critical role in relation detection. Our experiments confirm that the performance of state-of-the-art visual relation detection approaches can significantly be improved by utilizing depth map information.
