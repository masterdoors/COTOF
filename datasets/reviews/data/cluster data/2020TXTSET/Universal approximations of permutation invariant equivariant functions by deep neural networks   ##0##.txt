In this paper, we develop a theory about the relationship between -invariant equivariant functions and deep neural networks for finite group . Especially, for a given -invariant equivariant function, we construct its universal approximator by deep neural network whose layers equip -actions and each affine transformations are -equivariant invariant. Due to representation theory, we can show that this approximator has exponentially fewer free parameters than usual models. finite group, invariant, equivariant, neural networks
