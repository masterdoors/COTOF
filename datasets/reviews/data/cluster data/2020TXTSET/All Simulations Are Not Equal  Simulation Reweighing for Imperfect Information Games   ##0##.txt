Imperfect information games are challenging benchmarks for artificial intelligent systems. To reason and plan under uncertainty is a key towards general AI. Traditionally, large amounts of simulations are used in imperfect information games, and they sometimes perform sub-optimally due to large state and action spaces. In this work, we propose a simulation reweighing mechanism using neural networks. It performs backwards verification to public previous actions and assign proper belief weights to the simulations from the information set of the current observation, using an incomplete state solver network (ISSN). We use simulation reweighing in the playing phase of the game contract bridge, and show that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulation based methods, and achieves better play per decision.
