To understand how object vision develops in infancy and childhood, it will be necessary to develop testable computational models. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven valuable as models of adult vision, but it is not yet clear if they have any value as models of development. As a first model, we measured learning in a DNN designed to mimic the architecture and representational geometry of the visual system (CORnet). We quantified the development of explicit object representations at each level of this network through training by freezing the convolutional layers and training an additional linear decoding layer. We evaluate decoding accuracy on the whole ImageNet validation set, and also for individual visual classes. CORnet, however, uses supervised training and because infants have only extremely impoverished access to labels they must instead learn in an unsupervised manner. We therefore also measured learning in a state-of-the-art unsupervised network (DeepCluster). CORnet and DeepCluster differ in both supervision and in the convolutional networks at their heart, thus to isolate the effect of supervision, we ran a control experiment in which we trained the convolutional network from DeepCluster (an AlexNet variant) in a supervised manner. We make predictions on how learning should develop across brain regions in infants. In all three networks, we also tested for a relationship in the order in which infants and machines acquire visual classes, and found only evidence for a counter-intuitive relationship. We discuss the potential reasons for this. deep learning, unsupervised, supervised, infant learning, age of acquisition, DeepCluster, CORnet, AlexNet
