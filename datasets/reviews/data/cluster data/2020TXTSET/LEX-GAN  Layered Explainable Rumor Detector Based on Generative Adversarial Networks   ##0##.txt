Social media have emerged to be increasingly popular and have been used as tools for gathering and propagating information. However, the vigorous growth of social media contributes to the fast-spreading and far-reaching rumors. Rumor detection has become a necessary defense. Traditional rumor detection methods based on hand-crafted feature selection are replaced by automatic approaches that are based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI decision making systems need to have the necessary means, such as explainability to assure users their trustworthiness. Inspired by the thriving development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on text applications, we propose LEX-GAN, a GAN-based layered explainable rumor detector to improve the detection quality and provide explainability. Unlike fake news detection that needs a previously collected verified news database, LEX-GAN realizes explainable rumor detection based on only tweet-level text. LEX-GAN is trained with generated non-rumor-looking rumors. The generators produce rumors by intelligently inserting controversial information in non-rumors, and force the discriminators to detect detailed glitches and deduce exactly which parts in the sentence are problematic. The layered structures in both generative and discriminative model contributes to the high performance. We show LEX-GAN s mutation detection ability in textural sequences by performing a gene classification and mutation detection task. explainable rumor detection, layered generative adversarial networks
