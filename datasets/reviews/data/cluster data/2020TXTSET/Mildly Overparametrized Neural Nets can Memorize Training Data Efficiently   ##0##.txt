It has been observed citep{zhang2016understanding} that deep neural networks can memorize  they achieve 100 % accuracy on training data. Recent theoretical results explained such behavior in highly overparametrized regimes, where the number of neurons in each layer is larger than the number of training samples. In this paper, we show that neural networks can be trained to memorize training data perfectly in a mildly overparametrized regime, where the number of parameters is just a constant factor more than the number of training samples, and the number of neurons is much smaller. nonconvex optimization, optimization landscape, overparametrization
