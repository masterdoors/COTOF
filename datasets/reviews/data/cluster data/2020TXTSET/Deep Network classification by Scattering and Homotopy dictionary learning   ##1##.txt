We introduce a sparse scattering deep convolutional neural network, which provides a simple model to analyze properties of deep representation learning for classification. Learning a single dictionary matrix with a classifier yields a higher classification accuracy than AlexNet over the ImageNet ILSVRC2012 dataset. The network first applies a scattering transform which linearizes variabilities due to geometric transformations such as translations and small deformations. A sparse l1 dictionary coding reduces intra-class variability while preserving class separation through projections over unions of linear spaces. It is implemented in a deep convolutional network with a homotopy algorithm having an exponential convergence. A convergence proof is given in a general framework including ALISTA. Classification results are analyzed over ImageNet. dictionary learning, scattering transform, sparse coding, imagenet
