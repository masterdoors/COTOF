Compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) is important for real-world applications operating on resource-constrained devices. However, it is difficult to change the model size once the training is completed, which needs re-training to configure models suitable for different devices. In this paper, we propose a novel method that enables DNNs to flexibly change their size after training. We factorize the weight matrices of the DNNs via singular value decomposition (SVD) and change their ranks according to the target size. In contrast with existing methods, we introduce simple criteria that characterize the importance of each basis and layer, which enables to effectively compress the error and complexity of models as little as possible. In experiments on multiple image-classification tasks, our method exhibits favorable performance compared with other methods.
