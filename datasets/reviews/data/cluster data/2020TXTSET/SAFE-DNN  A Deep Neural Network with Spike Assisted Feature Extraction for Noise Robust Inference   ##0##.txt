We present a Deep Neural Network with Spike Assisted Feature Extraction (SAFE-DNN) to improve robustness of classification under stochastic perturbation of inputs. The proposed network augments a DNN with unsupervised learning of low-level features using spiking neuron network (SNN) with Spike-Time-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP). The complete network learns to ignore local perturbation while performing global feature detection and classification. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet subset demonstrate improved noise robustness for multiple DNN architectures without sacrificing accuracy on clean images.
