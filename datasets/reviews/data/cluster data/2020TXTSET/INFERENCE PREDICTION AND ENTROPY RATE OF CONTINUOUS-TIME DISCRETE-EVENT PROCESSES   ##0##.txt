The inference of models, prediction of future symbols, and entropy rate estimation of discrete-time, discrete-event processes is well-worn ground. However, many time series are better conceptualized as continuous-time, discrete-event processes. Here, we provide new methods for inferring models, predicting future symbols, and estimating the entropy rate of continuous-time, discrete-event processes. The methods rely on an extension of Bayesian structural inference that takes advantage of neural networkâ€™s universal approximation power. Based on experiments with simple synthetic data, these new methods seem to be competitive with state-of- the-art methods for prediction and entropy rate estimation as long as the correct model is inferred. continuous-time prediction
