Quantization is a crucial technique for achieving low-power, low latency and high throughput hardware implementations of Deep Neural Networks. Quantized floating point representations have received recent interest due to their hardware efficiency benefits and ability to represent a higher dynamic range than fixed point representations, leading to improvements in accuracy. We present a novel technique, Monte Carlo Deep Neural Network Arithmetic (MCA), for determining the sensitivity of Deep Neural Networks to quantization in floating point arithmetic.We do this by applying Monte Carlo Arithmetic to the inference computation and analyzing the relative standard deviation of the neural network loss. The method makes no assumptions regarding the underlying parameter distributions. We evaluate our method on pre-trained image classification models on the CIFAR10 andImageNet datasets. For the same network topology and dataset, we demonstrate the ability to gain the equivalent of bits of precision by simply choosing weight parameter sets which demonstrate a lower loss of significance from the Monte Carlo trials. Additionally, we can apply MCA to compare the sensitivity of different network topologies to quantization effects. deep learning, quantization, floating point, monte carlo methods
