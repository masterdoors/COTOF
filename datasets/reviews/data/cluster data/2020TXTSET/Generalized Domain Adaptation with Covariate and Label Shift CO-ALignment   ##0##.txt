Unsupervised knowledge transfer has a great potential to improve the generalizability of deep models to novel domains. Yet the current literature assumes that the label distribution is domain-invariant and only aligns the covariate or vice versa. In this paper, we explore the task of Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA)  How to transfer knowledge across different domains in the presence of both covariate and label shift  We propose a covariate and label distribution CO-ALignment (COAL) model to tackle this problem. Our model leverages prototype-based conditional alignment and label distribution estimation to diminish the covariate and label shifts, respectively. We demonstrate experimentally that when both types of shift exist in the data, COAL leads to state-of-the-art performance on several cross-domain benchmarks.
