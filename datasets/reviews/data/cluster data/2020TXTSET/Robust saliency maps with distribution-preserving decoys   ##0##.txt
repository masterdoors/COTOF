Saliency methods help to make deep neural network predictions more interpretable by identifying particular features, such as pixels in an image, that contribute most strongly to the network s prediction. Unfortunately, recent evidence suggests that many saliency methods perform poorly when gradients are saturated or in the presence of strong inter-feature dependence or noise injected by an adversarial attack. In this work, we propose a data-driven technique that uses the distribution-preserving decoys to infer robust saliency scores in conjunction with a pre-trained convolutional neural network classifier and any off-the-shelf saliency method. We formulate the generation of decoys as an optimization problem, potentially applicable to any convolutional network architecture. We also propose a novel decoy-enhanced saliency score, which provably compensates for gradient saturation and considers joint activation patterns of pixels in a single-layer convolutional neural network. Empirical results on the ImageNet data set using three different deep neural network architectures---VGGNet, AlexNet and ResNet---show both qualitatively and quantitatively that decoy-enhanced saliency scores outperform raw scores produced by three existing saliency methods. explainable machine learning, explainable AI, deep learning interpretability, saliency maps, perturbation, convolutional neural network
