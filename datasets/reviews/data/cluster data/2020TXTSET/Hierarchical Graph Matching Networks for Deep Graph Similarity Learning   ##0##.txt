While the celebrated graph neural networks yields effective representations for individual nodes of a graph, there has been relatively less success in extending to deep graph similarity learning. Recent work has considered either global-level graph-graph interactions or low-level node-node interactions, ignoring the rich cross-level interactions between parts of a graph and a whole graph. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Matching Network (HGMN) for computing the graph similarity between any pair of graph-structured objects. Our model jointly learns graph representations and a graph matching metric function for computing graph similarity in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed HGMN model consists of a multi-perspective node-graph matching network for effectively learning cross-level interactions between parts of a graph and a whole graph, and a siamese graph neural network for learning global-level interactions between two graphs. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed HGMN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph matching networks baselines for both classification and regression tasks.
